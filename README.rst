Developer activity data collection for statistical analysis experimentation.


The point of this project is to serve as a sandbox for verifying statistical
methods of analysis used in other projects.

Uncertainty is reduced because the data represent the entire population we
wish to analyze. This allows us to experiment with unfamiliar statistical
models in a way that will allow us to understand the results more clearly
before applying them to a population sample we don't know much about.

A secondary benefit of this project is to understand what information about
the team activity is the most useful. In particular, we can evaluate the
effectiveness of project management strategies, for example by looking at
metrics over time or considering if missing data points are due to process
gaps.
